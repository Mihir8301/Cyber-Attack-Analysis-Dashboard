This work addresses critical cybersecurity challenges by introducing a unique open-source platform that utilizes data analysis and advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama3. The platform is designed to empower various users—including individuals, business owners, and government officials—by allowing them to input specific parameters to visualize analyzed data on cyber threats. Additionally, Llama3 will provide personalized recommendations for system protection and strategic advice in the event of a cyber-attack. By integrating AI-driven insights with customizable user inputs, this platform aims to offer a comprehensive, accurate, and user-friendly approach to understanding and mitigating cyber risks. The open-source nature of the platform democratizes access to vital cybersecurity insights, contributing significantly to global digital security efforts.
